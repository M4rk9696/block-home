# Getting Started

## Features

- Each tile can be customised with URL, Icon, Color
- List of Quotes can be given, which would be chosen at random for each new tab
- Optionally quotes can be shown as a notification, default disabled

## Setup

Unfortunately, I took down the extension from the extension store. Build from source to use it

### Building from source

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and Yarn installed.*

```bash
  yarn install
  yarn build
```

The final build will be in home-blocks folder.
* Go to Manage Extensions in Chrome
